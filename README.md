SIMPLE SHELL
A shell is a mechanism with which an interactive user can send commands to the OS
and by which the OS can respond to the user. The OS assumes a simple characteroriented
interface in which the user types a string of characters (terminated by
pressing the Enter or Return key) and the OS responds by typing lines of characters
back to the screen. The character-oriented shell assumes a screen display with a fixed
number of lines (say 25) and a fixed number of characters (say 80) per line
